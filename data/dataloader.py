#based on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7323664/python-generator-pre-fetch
This is a single-function package that transforms arbitrary generator into a background-thead generator that 
prefetches several batches of data in a parallel background thead.

This is useful if you have a computationally heavy process (CPU or GPU) that 
iteratively processes minibatches from the generator while the generator 
consumes some other resource (disk IO / loading from database / more CPU if you have unused cores). 

By default these two processes will constantly wait for one another to finish. If you make generator work in 
prefetch mode (see examples below), they will work in parallel, potentially saving you your GPU time.
We personally use the prefetch generator when iterating minibatches of data for deep learning with PyTorch etc.

        This function transforms generator into a background-thead generator.
        :param generator: generator or genexp or any
        It can be used with any minibatch generator.

        It is quite lightweight, but not entirely weightless.
        Using global variables inside generator is not recommended (may raise GIL and zero-out the
        benefit of having a background thread.)
        The ideal use case is when everything it requires is store inside it and everything it
        outputs is passed through queue.

        There's no restriction on doing weird stuff, reading/writing files, retrieving
        URLs [or whatever] wlilst iterating.

        :param max_prefetch: defines, how many iterations (at most) can background generator keep
        stored at any moment of time.
        Whenever there's already max_prefetch batches stored in queue, the background process will halt until
        one of these batches is dequeued.

        !Default max_prefetch=1 is okay unless you deal with some weird file IO in your generator!

        Setting max_prefetch to -1 lets it store as many batches as it can, which will work
        slightly (if any) faster, but will require storing
        all batches in memory. If you use infinite generator with max_prefetch=-1, it will exceed the RAM size
        unless dequeued quickly enough.
